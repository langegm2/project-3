## About
This project takes in a large amount of global emissions data for the entire world. Through multiple techniques we have created a locally-hosted site that shows our information dynamically.

We started by using Python to clean the initial .csv dataset.

Once we had the initial dataframe created, we double checked for null values.

Then, we created a SQL database for our information.

Once we had the database in place, we built an API that pulls the information from that database. 

At that point we were able to put it all together using HTML and Javascript to allow our information to be viewed dynamically.

We were able to create a dynamic pie chart and bar chart using our data.
